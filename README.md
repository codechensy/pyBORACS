# PyBORACS - Python Borehole Acoustic Simulation

2D borehole acoustic finite-difference simulation in Python. 

Models in PyBORACS include:
* Open hole and cased hole
* Subsurface model with heterogeneities (fracture, shale lamination)
* Wellbore environments (steel casing, mud cake, invaded zone, washout)
* Oil-water contact
